## Things I learnt from these Problems (or got stuck in):

1. [Smart Phone Problem](./1.Basics-Warm-Up/4.SmartPhone.cpp) - Sort Array and then find out Max of { A[i] * (N - i) }
2. [Multiple of 3](./1.Basics-Warm-Up/8.Multiple-of-3.cpp) - Mod 10 cycles repeat after every 4 iterations.. (It's just Complex Maths.. I still don't get it)
